## Peer-Inspired UI Improvements (D1.d)

1. ** *“Tomato Thrower” by emart149*  
**Gallery:** https://rndmcnlly.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-d1-gallery/

**What I liked:**  
This project used a very clean and minimal layout — everything was centered and easy to read.  
The light background and simple vertical stacking made the UI feel much more polished and welcoming.

**What I added to my project:**  
- Centered all UI elements using Flexbox  
- Added a soft light background color  
- Cleaned spacing around the counter, button, and shop  
- Improved readability with consistent typography  



2. “Ember Epoch” by camcimahir*  
**Gallery:** https://rndmcnlly.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-d1-gallery/

**What I liked:**  
Their game used a bold, attention-grabbing main button and a large icon at the top of the page.  
This made the primary action feel more important and gave the UI a stronger theme.

**What I added to my project:**  
- Redesigned my main action button to be larger and more visually dominant  
- Styled it with a fire-themed orange color + hover animation  
- Added a fire icon at the top of my UI  
- Rethemed my game from CPU cycles to an “Oil Thrower” fire-growth theme
